# Wireless-Sensor-Network

This is a individual project for SMU Algorithm course, which can select two or more largest bipartite subgraphs covering max area of the sensor network of million nodes.

There are three parts in this project. 

In first part, it will randomly generate the given number of nodes by square shape and circle shape respevtively. Then, it would connect every pair of nodes within a given distance in a linear time.

In second part, it will color all nodes with minimum number of colors by Smalles-Last-Coloring method that makes every adjacent node different color.

In the third part, it will determine two largest bipartite subgrahs using DFS that contains most edges of this wireless sensor network

P.S. Running this program needs Processing.
